  Imagine you are getting the above users collection from a MongoDB database.
    a. Create a function called signUp which allows user to add to the collection.
     If user exists, inform the user that he has already an account.  
    b. Create a function called signIn which allows user to sign in to the application  */

/*3. The products array has three elements and each of them has six properties.
    a. Create a function called rateProduct which rates the product
    b. Create a function called averageRating which calculate the average rating of a product */ 

/*4. Create a function called likeProduct. This function will helps to like to the product if 
it is not liked and remove like if it was liked.*/
