This directory is for a project of an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React, (which has memory of moves and lets player return to previous moves) built from scratch with help of Intro to React tutorial resources and code snippets.
I used my knowledge of JavaScript and the little i know of React to follow the tutorial closely and make the tic-tac-toe game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
